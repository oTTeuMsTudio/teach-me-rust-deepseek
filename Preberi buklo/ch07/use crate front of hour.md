Letâ€™s break this down step by step and understand the issue, why it happens, and how to resolve it.

---

### **Understanding the Code**
1. **Module Structure**:
   - You have a module `front_of_house` with a sub-module `hosting`.
   - Inside `hosting`, there is a public function `add_to_waitlist`.
   - The `use crate::front_of_house::hosting;` statement brings the `hosting` module into scope at the top level of the file.

2. **Customer Module**:
   - The `customer` module has a function `eat_at_restaurant` that tries to call `hosting::add_to_waitlist`.

3. **The Warning**:
   - The warning indicates that the `use crate::front_of_house::hosting;` statement is unused in its current scope.
   - This is because the `use` statement is declared at the top level (outside any module), but the `customer` module does not automatically inherit it. Instead, the `customer` module has its own scope.

---

### **Why the Warning Occurs**
- In Rust, each module has its own scope. A `use` statement only applies to the scope in which it is declared.
- Since the `use crate::front_of_house::hosting;` statement is declared at the top level, it is not visible inside the `customer` module.
- As a result, when `eat_at_restaurant` tries to call `hosting::add_to_waitlist`, it cannot find `hosting` because the `use` statement is out of scope.

---

### **How to Fix It**
There are two main ways to resolve this issue:

#### **Option 1: Move the `use` Statement Inside the `customer` Module**
By moving the `use` statement inside the `customer` module, you bring `hosting` into the scope of the `customer` module, making it accessible.

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

mod customer {
    // Bring `hosting` into the scope of the `customer` module
    use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }
}
```

Here, the `use` statement is now inside the `customer` module, so `hosting` is in scope for `eat_at_restaurant`.

---

#### **Option 2: Use `super` to Reference the Parent Module**
If you want to keep the `use` statement at the top level, you can reference the shortcut in the parent module using `super`. The `super` keyword allows you to access items from the parent module.

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

mod customer {
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        // Use `super` to reference the `hosting` shortcut from the parent module
        super::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }
}
```

Here, `super::hosting` refers to the `hosting` shortcut defined at the top level (in the parent module).

---

### **Which Option Should You Choose?**
- **Option 1** is generally preferred because it keeps the `use` statement close to where it is used, improving readability and reducing confusion.
- **Option 2** is useful if you want to centralize your `use` statements at the top level and avoid repeating them in multiple modules.

---

### **Final Code Example (Using Option 1)**

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

mod customer {
    use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }
}
```

This version avoids warnings and ensures that the `hosting` module is properly brought into scope for the `customer` module.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. Each module in Rust has its own scope.
2. A `use` statement only applies to the scope in which it is declared.
3. To resolve scope issues:
   - Move the `use` statement into the relevant module (preferred).
   - Use `super` to reference shortcuts from the parent module.
