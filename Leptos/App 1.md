# Build XR and Mobile App using Leptos
Leptos is a modern web framework for building reactive user interfaces in Rust. While Leptos itself is primarily focused on web development, you can leverage it to build the front-end of your application and integrate it with tools like WebXR for VR/XR experiences or frameworks like Tauri for mobile app development.

Lets write a VR/XR and mobile app using Leptos in Rust. We'll break this into three main parts:

1. **Setting Up Leptos for Web Development**
2. **Integrating WebXR for VR/XR Experiences**
3. **Building a Mobile App Using Tauri**

---

### **1. Setting Up Leptos for Web Development**

#### **Step 1.1: Install Rust**
If you haven't already installed Rust, you can do so by running:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
After installation, ensure `cargo` (Rust's package manager) is available by running:
```bash
cargo --version
```

#### **Step 1.2: Create a New Leptos Project**
Leptos provides a starter template to quickly scaffold a new project. Run the following commands:
```bash
cargo install cargo-leptos
cargo leptos new my-vr-app
cd my-vr-app
```

This will create a new Leptos project in the `my-vr-app` directory.

#### **Step 1.3: Run the Development Server**
To start the development server, run:
```bash
cargo leptos serve
```
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the default Leptos app.

### **2. Integrating WebXR for VR/XR Experiences**

WebXR is a JavaScript API that enables VR and AR experiences in web browsers. Since Leptos compiles to WebAssembly (WASM), you can use JavaScript interop to integrate WebXR into your Rust code.

#### **Step 2.1: Add WebXR to Your Project**
You need to include the WebXR polyfill or library in your `index.html`. Open the `index.html` file in your Leptos project and add the following script tag:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/webxr-polyfill@latest/build/webxr-polyfill.js"></script>
```

#### **Step 2.2: Write JavaScript Interop Code**
Create a new file called `webxr.js` in the `static` directory of your Leptos project. Add the following code to initialize WebXR:
```javascript
function initWebXR() {
    if (!navigator.xr) {
        console.error("WebXR not supported in this browser.");
        return;
    }

    navigator.xr.isSessionSupported('immersive-vr').then((supported) => {
        if (supported) {
            console.log("WebXR immersive-vr session is supported.");
            // Start the XR session here
        } else {
            console.error("WebXR immersive-vr session is not supported.");
        }
    });
}

window.initWebXR = initWebXR;
```

#### **Step 2.3: Call JavaScript from Rust**
In your Rust code (e.g., `src/main.rs`), use the `wasm-bindgen` crate to call the `initWebXR` function. First, add `wasm-bindgen` to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
```

Then, modify your Rust code to call the JavaScript function:
```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
extern "C" {
    #[wasm_bindgen(js_namespace = window)]
    fn initWebXR();
}

fn main() {
    // Initialize WebXR when the app starts
    initWebXR();
}
```

#### **Step 2.4: Build and Test**
Run the development server again:
```bash
cargo leptos serve
```
Open your browser and check the console logs to verify that WebXR is initialized.

### **3. Building a Mobile App Using Tauri**

Tauri is a framework for building lightweight, secure, and fast desktop and mobile applications using Rust and web technologies. You can combine Tauri with Leptos to create a mobile app.

#### **Step 3.1: Install Tauri CLI**
Install the Tauri CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli
```

#### **Step 3.2: Initialize a Tauri Project**
Inside your Leptos project directory, initialize a Tauri project:
```bash
tauri init
```
Follow the prompts to configure your Tauri app. Ensure the `distDir` points to the output directory of your Leptos app (e.g., `target/site`).

#### **Step 3.3: Modify `tauri.conf.json`**
Open the `tauri.conf.json` file and configure the `build` section to match your Leptos setup:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "distDir": "../target/site",
    "devPath": "http://localhost:3000"
  }
}
```

#### **Step 3.4: Build the Mobile App**
To build the app for Android or iOS, ensure you have the necessary SDKs installed. For Android, you need the Android NDK and SDK. For iOS, you need Xcode.

Run the following command to build the app:
```bash
tauri build --target android
```
or
```bash
tauri build --target ios
```

#### **Step 3.5: Test the App**
Use an emulator or connect a physical device to test your app. For Android, you can use:
```bash
adb install path/to/your/app.apk
```
For iOS, open the `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode and run the app on a simulator or device.

### **Final Notes**

- **WebXR Integration**: The WebXR example provided is a basic setup. For a full VR/XR experience, you'll need to handle rendering, input devices (e.g., controllers), and scene management. Libraries like Three.js or Babylon.js can help with this.
- **Mobile App Performance**: Leptos + Tauri apps are highly performant, but ensure you optimize your Rust code and minimize unnecessary DOM updates.
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test your app on multiple devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.

By combining Leptos, WebXR, and Tauri, you can create powerful VR/XR and mobile applications entirely in Rust.
