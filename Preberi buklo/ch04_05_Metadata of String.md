Let me explain this in simple terms:

### Key Idea:
In Rust, `&String` and `&str` are two different types of references to strings, and they take up different amounts of memory. Here's why:

---

### 1. **What is `&String`?**
- A `String` in Rust is a growable, heap-allocated string type.
- When you create a reference to a `String` (i.e., `&String`), it is just a pointer to the `String` object in memory.
- On a 64-bit system, a pointer takes **8 bytes** of memory.

So, `&String` is **8 bytes** because it only stores a single pointer.

---

### 2. **What is `&str`?**
- An `&str` is a "string slice," which is a reference to part of a string. It consists of two things:
  1. A **pointer** to the start of the string data in memory.
  2. A **length** that tells how many characters (or bytes) the slice includes.
- Since both the pointer and the length need to be stored, `&str` takes **16 bytes** on a 64-bit system (8 bytes for the pointer + 8 bytes for the length).

---

### 3. **Why does `&str` use more memory than `&String`?**
- `&String` is just a pointer to a `String` object, so it only needs 8 bytes.
- `&str`, however, needs extra information (the length) to describe the slice of the string it refers to, so it takes 16 bytes.

---

### 4. **How to Verify This?**
You can use the `std::mem::size_of` function to check the size of these types in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!(
        "&String = {} bytes, &str = {} bytes",
        std::mem::size_of::<&String>(), // Prints 8
        std::mem::size_of::<&str>(),   // Prints 16
    );
}
```

Output:
```
&String = 8 bytes, &str = 16 bytes
```

This confirms that `&String` is smaller than `&str`.

---

### 5. **Implicit Conversion**
Rust is smart about converting between `&String` and `&str` based on what the code expects:
- If the context expects a `&String`, Rust will give you a reference to the whole `String`.
- If the context expects an `&str`, Rust will create a slice reference (`&str`) that points to part or all of the `String`.

For example:
```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
let s_ref: &String = &s; // Reference to the whole String (8 bytes)
let s_slice: &str = &s;  // Slice reference to the string data (16 bytes)
```

Here, `&s` produces two different values (`&String` or `&str`) depending on the expected type.

---

### Summary:
- `&String` is a simple pointer (8 bytes).
- `&str` is a slice reference with a pointer and a length (16 bytes).
- Rust automatically converts between `&String` and `&str` based on the context.

**Final Answer:**  
`&String` uses **8 bytes**, while `&str` uses **16 bytes**.
