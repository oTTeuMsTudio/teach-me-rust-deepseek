# What is happening in the code?

The code defines a small program in **Rust** that creates an **enumeration (enum)** to represent different types of IP addresses. Then, it creates two examples of IP addresses: one for IPv4 and another for IPv6.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

#### 1. **Defining the `IpAddr` Enum**
```rust
enum IpAddr {
    V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
    V6(String),
}
```
- Here, we define an **enum** called `IpAddr`. An enum is like a list of possible options or types.
- This enum has **two variants**:
  - `V4`: Represents an IPv4 address. It contains **four `u8` numbers** (each between 0 and 255) because IPv4 addresses are made up of four numbers separated by dots (e.g., `127.0.0.1`).
  - `V6`: Represents an IPv6 address. It contains a **String** because IPv6 addresses are more complex and written as text (e.g., `::1`).

---

#### 2. **Creating an IPv4 Address**
```rust
let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);
```
- This line creates a variable named `home` and assigns it an IPv4 address using the `V4` variant of the `IpAddr` enum.
- The IPv4 address is `127.0.0.1`, which is a special address called "localhost" (used to refer to your own computer).

---

#### 3. **Creating an IPv6 Address**
```rust
let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```
- This line creates a variable named `loopback` and assigns it an IPv6 address using the `V6` variant of the `IpAddr` enum.
- The IPv6 address is `::1`, which is also a "localhost" address but in IPv6 format.

---

### Why Use an Enum?
Using an enum here is helpful because:
1. **It groups related things together**: Both IPv4 and IPv6 are types of IP addresses, so they belong in the same `IpAddr` enum.
2. **It ensures type safety**: Rust will make sure you only use valid IP addresses (either `V4` or `V6`) and won't mix them up with other data types.

---

### Summary
- The program defines an `IpAddr` enum to represent IP addresses.
- It creates two examples:
  - `home`: An IPv4 address (`127.0.0.1`).
  - `loopback`: An IPv6 address (`::1`).
- Enums are a neat way to handle different types of related data in Rust.
