# Introduction to Building a Forum with Rust and Axum (Part 1)
Creating an axum forum app using rust axum adding a lot of features like:
1. Authentication ( Login & Register )
2. Full CRUD app
3. MVC pattern ( Templating with Askama crate )
4. Routing and middlewares with Axum
5. Request Validation and flash messages
6. Styling with Tailwind
7. SQLx migrations, queries, joins and mapping ( postgres )
8. Dealing with Forms and flash messages
9. Authorization
10. Dates with chrono crate
11. Rust modules
12. Downloading assets
13. AlpineJs menu show/hide


Welcome to this beginner-friendly guide on building a forum application using **Rust** and the **Axum** web framework. This series will walk you through creating a simple yet functional forum application step by step. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a basic understanding of how to build web applications in Rust using Axum.

### 1. What is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes **performance**, **safety**, and **concurrency**. It was designed to provide memory safety without a garbage collector, making it an excellent choice for building high-performance applications like web servers, operating systems, and game engines.

Key features of Rust:
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership model ensures no data races or memory leaks at compile time.
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level abstractions without sacrificing performance.
- **Concurrency**: Built-in tools for safe concurrent programming.
- **Ecosystem**: A rich ecosystem of libraries (called "crates") available via [crates.io](https://crates.io).

For web development, Rust has gained popularity due to its speed and reliability, making it a great alternative to traditional languages like Python or JavaScript.

### 2. Why Use Axum?

**Axum** is a modern web framework built on top of **Tokio** (an asynchronous runtime) and **Tower** (a library for building robust network services). It is designed to be lightweight, modular, and easy to use while providing powerful features for building web applications.

Why choose Axum?
- **Asynchronous by Default**: Axum leverages Rust's async/await syntax for non-blocking I/O operations.
- **Modular Design**: You can pick and choose components based on your needs.
- **Built on Tokio**: Axum integrates seamlessly with Tokio, the most popular async runtime in Rust.
- **Type Safety**: Axum's design encourages type-safe APIs, reducing runtime errors.
- **Growing Community**: Axum has a rapidly growing community and excellent documentation.

Axum is particularly well-suited for building RESTful APIs, web servers, and microservices, making it a great choice for our forum application.

### 3. Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before we dive into coding, ensure your development environment is ready:

#### Install Rust
1. Download and install Rust from the official website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Verify the installation by running:
   ```bash
   rustc --version
   ```
   This should display the installed Rust version.

#### Install Cargo
Cargo is Rust's package manager and build tool. It comes bundled with Rust, so you don't need to install it separately.

#### Install a Code Editor
We recommend using **Visual Studio Code** with the **rust-analyzer** extension for a smooth development experience.

### 4. Creating a New Rust Project

To create a new Rust project, open your terminal and run:
```bash
cargo new rust-forum
cd rust-forum
```

This command creates a new directory called `rust-forum` with the following structure:
```
rust-forum/
├── Cargo.toml
└── src/
    └── main.rs
```

- **`Cargo.toml`**: The manifest file where dependencies and metadata are defined.
- **`src/main.rs`**: The entry point of your application.

---

### 5. Adding Dependencies

Axum requires several dependencies to function properly. Open the `Cargo.toml` file and add the following under `[dependencies]`:

```toml
[dependencies]
axum = "0.6"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
tower = "0.4"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

Here’s what each dependency does:
- **`axum`**: The web framework we’ll use to build the forum.
- **`tokio`**: The async runtime required by Axum.
- **`tower`**: Middleware support for Axum.
- **`serde` and `serde_json`**: For serializing and deserializing JSON data.

Run the following command to download and compile the dependencies:
```bash
cargo build
```

---

### 6. Building a Simple "Hello, World!" Server

Now, let’s write some code to create a basic server that responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed.

Open `src/main.rs` and replace its contents with the following:

```rust
use axum::{
    routing::get,
    Router,
};
use std::net::SocketAddr;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Define a simple route
    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(|| async { "Hello, World!" }));

    // Bind the server to a local address
    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000));
    println!("Listening on http://{}", addr);

    // Run the server
    axum::Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
```

#### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Route Definition**:
   - `Router::new().route("/", get(|| async { "Hello, World!" }))`: Defines a single route (`/`) that responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed via a GET request.
2. **Server Binding**:
   - `SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000))`: Binds the server to `localhost` on port `3000`.
3. **Server Execution**:
   - `axum::Server::bind(&addr).serve(app.into_make_service())`: Starts the server and serves the application.

---

### 7. Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
cargo run
```

You should see output similar to:
```
Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. You should see the message:
```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You’ve successfully created a basic web server using Rust and Axum.

## Summary

In this first part, we:
1. Introduced Rust and Axum.
2. Set up our development environment.
3. Created a new Rust project.
4. Added necessary dependencies.
5. Built and ran a simple "Hello, World!" server.

In the next part, we’ll expand our application by adding routes for user registration, login, and creating forum posts. Stay tuned!
