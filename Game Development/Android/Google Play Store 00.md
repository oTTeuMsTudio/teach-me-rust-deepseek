# Let's dive deeper into Option B: Wrap It in a WebView (Advanced) 

How to take your Easel game and turn it into an Android app that you can publish on the Google Play Store.

## üß© What Is a WebView?

A **WebView** is like a mini web browser inside an Android app. You can load any website or HTML page inside it ‚Äî including your Easel game, which runs in the browser.

So essentially, you're creating a very simple Android app whose only job is to show your Easel game inside this WebView.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a WebView App for Your Easel Game

### 1. ‚úÖ Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have:
- A published Easel game with a public URL.
- **Android Studio** installed (free from [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/studio)).
- Basic understanding of Android development concepts (no need to be an expert).
- Some familiarity with **Kotlin** or **Java** (Android‚Äôs main programming languages).

> We‚Äôll use **Kotlin**, as it's now preferred by Google.

---

### 2. üéÆ Create a New Project in Android Studio

1. Open **Android Studio**.
2. Click **"New Project"**.
3. Choose **"Empty Activity"**.
4. Set:
   - Name: `MyEaselGameApp`
   - Language: **Kotlin**
   - Minimum SDK: Pick something like **API 21 (Android 5.0)** unless you have a reason to go lower.
5. Click **Finish**.

This creates a basic Android app project.

### 3. üìÑ Modify the Layout (activity_main.xml)

You want to replace the default layout with a **WebView**.

1. Go to `res/layout/activity_main.xml`.
2. Switch to **Code** view.
3. Replace its contents with:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<WebView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:id="@+id/webview"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

This makes your entire app screen just a WebView.

### 4. üß† Load Your Easel Game in the WebView

Go to `MainActivity.kt` and change the code to:

```kotlin
package com.example.myeaselgameapp

import android.os.Bundle
import android.webkit.WebView
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        val webView = WebView(this)
        setContentView(webView)

        // Enable JavaScript if your game uses it
        webView.settings.javaScriptEnabled = true

        // Load your Easel game URL
        webView.loadUrl("https://easel.games/@yourname/yourgame")
    }
}
```

Replace `"https://easel.games/@yourname/yourgame"` with your actual Easel game URL.

‚úÖ This sets up a WebView and loads your Easel game in it.

---

### 5. üîå Add Internet Permission

Since your app needs to access the internet, add this line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

Place it **before** the `<application>` tag.

---

### 6. üß™ Test Your App

1. Connect an Android device via USB or use the emulator.
2. Click the **Run** button in Android Studio.
3. Your Easel game should open in the app!

---

### 7. üì¶ Generate a Signed APK / AAB

To upload to the Play Store, you need to generate a signed release build.

1. In Android Studio, go to **Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK**.
2. Choose **APK** or **Android App Bundle (AAB)** (Google prefers AAB now).
3. Create a keystore (or use an existing one if you‚Äôve published before).
4. Complete the steps and build your app.

---

### 8. üöÄ Upload to Google Play Console

1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console).
2. Sign in with your developer account (you need to pay a one-time $25 fee).
3. Click **Create Application**.
4. Fill out all required details:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Screenshots
   - Category
   - Content rating
   - Pricing
5. Upload your **AAB or APK** under the **Release** section.
6. Review and click **Review Release**, then **Start Rollout to Production**.

Your app will be reviewed (usually takes 1‚Äì2 days) and then appear on the Play Store!

## üéÅ Bonus Tips

### üîß Optional Features
- **Splash Screen**: Show a loading screen while the game loads.
- **Offline Support**: If you host your own HTML/JS files locally in the app, you can allow offline play.
- **Custom Icons & Names**: Change the app name and icon in `res/mipmap` folders and `AndroidManifest.xml`.
