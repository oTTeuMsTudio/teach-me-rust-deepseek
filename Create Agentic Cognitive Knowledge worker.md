# Agentic Cognitive Knowledge Worker as a Machine

Let's break this down step by step. We'll create a Rust program that simulates a "Managing Agent" with roles of a Solutions Architect and Backend Developer. The program will take user input as a goal, process it, and print it out.

Hereâ€™s how we can structure the program:

1. **Define Roles**: Create structs for `SolutionsArchitect` and `BackendDeveloper` to represent their responsibilities.
2. **User Input**: Use the standard library to accept user input for the goal.
3. **Process Goal**: Have the managing agent delegate the goal to the appropriate role and print it.

Below is the complete Rust program:

```rust
use std::io;

// Define the Solutions Architect role
struct SolutionsArchitect;

impl SolutionsArchitect {
    fn analyze_goal(&self, goal: &str) {
        println!("Solutions Architect analyzing the goal: {}", goal);
    }
}

// Define the Backend Developer role
struct BackendDeveloper;

impl BackendDeveloper {
    fn implement_goal(&self, goal: &str) {
        println!("Backend Developer implementing the goal: {}", goal);
    }
}

// Define the Managing Agent
struct ManagingAgent {
    solutions_architect: SolutionsArchitect,
    backend_developer: BackendDeveloper,
}

impl ManagingAgent {
    fn new() -> Self {
        ManagingAgent {
            solutions_architect: SolutionsArchitect,
            backend_developer: BackendDeveloper,
        }
    }

    // Delegate the goal to both roles
    fn manage_goal(&self, goal: &str) {
        self.solutions_architect.analyze_goal(goal);
        self.backend_developer.implement_goal(goal);
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Create a managing agent
    let managing_agent = ManagingAgent::new();

    // Prompt the user for input
    println!("Enter your goal:");

    // Read user input
    let mut user_input = String::new();
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut user_input)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    // Trim the newline character from the input
    let goal = user_input.trim();

    // Manage the goal
    managing_agent.manage_goal(goal);
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Structs for Roles**:
   - `SolutionsArchitect`: This struct has a method `analyze_goal` to simulate analyzing the user's goal.
   - `BackendDeveloper`: This struct has a method `implement_goal` to simulate implementing the user's goal.

2. **ManagingAgent Struct**:
   - This struct contains instances of `SolutionsArchitect` and `BackendDeveloper`.
   - It has a method `manage_goal` that delegates the goal to both roles.

3. **Main Function**:
   - A `ManagingAgent` instance is created.
   - The program prompts the user to enter a goal.
   - The user's input is read and passed to the `manage_goal` method of the `ManagingAgent`.

### How to Run the Program

1. Save the code in a file named `main.rs`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `main.rs`.
3. Compile the program using the Rust compiler:
   ```bash
   rustc main.rs
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```
5. Enter a goal when prompted, and the program will print how the managing agent processes it.

### Example Interaction

```
Enter your goal:
Build a scalable web application
Solutions Architect analyzing the goal: Build a scalable web application
Backend Developer implementing the goal: Build a scalable web application
```
