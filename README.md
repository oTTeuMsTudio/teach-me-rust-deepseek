# Studying AI Engineering (Agentic Cognitive Workflow Machine)
## Today cognitive labor may be automated. What is the new cognitive labor that gets created? Dont conflate knowledge worker with knowledge work. The knowledge work of today could probably be automated. Thats a different abstraction.
## Building UI Layer for Knowledge Work (CRUD Application) (end-to-end personal branding cognitive workflow machine)
### Agent with minimal requiremnts is doing what? Task in multiagentic internet is?: 
- run on whatever appropriate LLM there is,
- Ability to crawl LinkedIn and X to identify post and voices for certain keywords each day,
- Aggregate and analyze top posts,
- Idea Generation,
- Post/Copy generation in my style and tone of voice,
- Published vi API to each platform

### Nauči se programirati v sistemskem jeziku Rust. Potrebujemo znanje: development with LLMs, AI agents, and Vector Databases

## Pišemo programe: 
- Command line to-do list program
- Aplikacijo z workflow agenti
- Games, igre
- Generator 3D modelov
- Modelirnik CAD and Mesh
- Svoj CMS like Webflow ali podobno
- text-to-video generator za faceless YouTube Channel
- Advertising targeting metodo za LM Generations (meta ads are hyper targeted in feed but not within specific pieces of content. Within a return from chatgpt it is not clear how you should get a high quality placed ad within the output. While model cost coming down, with output ads you can get super high revenue per ... That revenue is totally untapped and technically it is not clear how it is done. Ads can / must be in conversation, in voice mode, etc. OpenAI and anthropic are purely laser focused on Agents and AGI. With AGI you can make tons of money or I can spend pay for everything. they think AGI is two, three years away.)
- Odprtokodni model agentov
- p2p chat
- Develop and optimize AI agents using LLM frameworks. Experiment with different agent architectures to improve performance and efficiency. Implement prompt engineering strategies to enhance the agent reasoning and task execution. Refine and iterate on agent performance, experiment with new architectures and optimize agent workflows.
- Bitcoin/Solana like kriptovaluto z blockchain like timestamp-om
- NoApi like aplikacijo. fully integrated rust web framework( Axum + leptos.dev)with Hot Reload – Instant updates without restarting the server, Type Syncing – Seamless type safety between frontend & backend, Rust Server Functions – Call Rust functions directly from the frontend, File-based Routing – Simple and intuitive route management, Fullstack (Leptos + Rust + Axum)
- Svoj Shell, Fyrox.rs, grep, Interpreter, HTTP server, Redis, BitTorrent, Kafka, Git, SQLite, DNS server
- Agent with minimal requiremnts: run on 4o or Sonnet 3.5, crawl LinkedIn and X to identify post and voices for certain keywords each day, aggreagaet
