# What is Leapcell?
Leapcell is a platform that helps developers build and manage applications easily, especially when those apps need to work across many computers (distributed systems). It provides tools, infrastructure, and services so you can focus on building your app without worrying about the backend complexities.

### What is Rust?
Rust is a programming language known for being fast, safe, and reliable. It’s great for building high-performance applications like websites or APIs.

### How to Build a Website App in Rust on Leapcell

Here’s how you can build a website app using Rust on Leapcell:

#### 1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Install Rust: First, you need to install Rust on your computer. You can do this by downloading it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
   - Install Leapcell CLI: Leapcell might provide a command-line tool (CLI) to interact with their platform. Install it by following their documentation.

#### 2. **Create a New Rust Project**
   - Open your terminal and run:
     ```
     cargo new my_website_app
     ```
     This creates a new Rust project called `my_website_app`.

#### 3. **Add Web Framework**
   - To build a website, you’ll need a web framework. A popular Rust web framework is **Actix-web** or **Rocket**.
   - Add the framework to your project by editing the `Cargo.toml` file. For example, for Actix-web:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     actix-web = "4.0"
     ```

#### 4. **Write Your Website Code**
   - In your Rust project, write the code to handle HTTP requests and serve web pages. Here’s an example using Actix-web:
     ```rust
     use actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer, Responder};

     async fn index() -> impl Responder {
         "Hello, world! Welcome to my Rust website on Leapcell!"
     }

     #[actix_web::main]
     async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
         HttpServer::new(|| {
             App::new().route("/", web::get().to(index))
         })
         .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
         .run()
         .await
     }
     ```
     This code creates a simple web server that responds with "Hello, world!" when you visit the homepage.

#### 5. **Test Locally**
   - Run your app locally to make sure it works:
     ```
     cargo run
     ```
   - Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. You should see your message.

#### 6. **Deploy to Leapcell**
   - Leapcell makes it easy to deploy your app. Use their CLI or dashboard:
     - Build your Rust app:
       ```
       cargo build --release
       ```
     - Upload your app to Leapcell using their deployment tools. For example:
       ```
       leapcell deploy ./target/release/my_website_app
       ```
     - Follow any additional instructions in Leapcell’s documentation to configure networking, databases, etc.

#### 7. **Scale and Monitor**
   - Once deployed, Leapcell will help you scale your app as traffic grows. Use their monitoring tools to track performance and fix issues.

### Why Use Rust and Leapcell Together?
- **Rust**: Ensures your app is fast and secure.
- **Leapcell**: Handles the infrastructure, so you don’t have to worry about servers, scaling, or reliability.

By combining Rust’s performance with Leapcell’s distributed platform, you can build a robust and scalable website app quickly.
