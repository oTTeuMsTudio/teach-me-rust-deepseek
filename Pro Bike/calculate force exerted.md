To calculate the force exerted on a bike pedal when you're riding at full speed, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. Here's how we can approach it:

---

### **1. Understanding the Physics**
The force on the bike pedal depends on several factors:
- **Your weight (mass × gravity)**: This determines the downward force you apply to the pedals.
- **Torque and gear ratio**: The torque you generate is related to the force on the pedal and the length of the crank arm.
- **Speed and power output**: At a constant speed, the power you generate is used to overcome air resistance (drag), rolling resistance, and other losses.

The main equation for power is:
$$
P = F \cdot v
$$
Where:
- $P$ is power (in watts),
- $F$ is the force applied (in newtons),
- $v$ is velocity (in meters per second).

If you're maintaining a constant speed, the force you apply to the pedals is indirectly related to overcoming resistive forces like drag.

### **2. Simplifying Assumptions**
For simplicity, let’s assume:
1. You are riding on flat terrain.
2. Air resistance is the dominant force opposing your motion.
3. Your pedaling efficiency is 100% (no energy losses in the drivetrain).
4. Your crank arm length is 170 mm (a typical value).
5. You are generating enough power to maintain 40 km/h.

We’ll calculate:
1. The drag force using aerodynamics.
2. The force on the pedal based on your power output.

---

### **3. Key Equations**
#### Drag Force
The drag force is given by:
$$
F_{\text{drag}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot C_d \cdot A \cdot v^2
$$
Where:
- $\rho$ is air density (approximately $1.225 \, \text{kg/m}^3$ at sea level),
- $C_d$ is the drag coefficient (assume $0.9$ for an upright cyclist),
- $A$ is the frontal area ($0.5 \, \text{m}^2$ is a typical estimate for a cyclist),
- $v$ is velocity in meters per second ($40 \, \text{km/h} = 11.11 \, \text{m/s}$).

#### Power Output
Power required to overcome drag:
$$
P = F_{\text{drag}} \cdot v
$$

#### Force on Pedal
The force on the pedal is related to the torque you generate. Assuming a crank arm length $L = 0.17 \, \text{m}$:
$$
F_{\text{pedal}} = \frac{\tau}{L}
$$
Where $\tau$ is the torque generated, which is proportional to your power output.

### **4. Rust Program**
Let’s write a Rust program to calculate the force on the pedal.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Constants
    let mass: f64 = 90.0; // Mass of the rider in kg
    let velocity_kmh: f64 = 40.0; // Velocity in km/h
    let velocity_ms: f64 = velocity_kmh / 3.6; // Convert to m/s
    let air_density: f64 = 1.225; // Air density in kg/m^3
    let drag_coefficient: f64 = 0.9; // Drag coefficient
    let frontal_area: f64 = 0.5; // Frontal area in m^2
    let crank_arm_length: f64 = 0.17; // Crank arm length in meters

    // Calculate drag force
    let drag_force = 0.5 * air_density * drag_coefficient * frontal_area * velocity_ms.powi(2);

    // Calculate power required to overcome drag
    let power = drag_force * velocity_ms;

    // Assume torque is proportional to power and cadence
    // For simplicity, assume cadence = 90 RPM (1.5 Hz)
    let cadence_hz: f64 = 1.5;
    let torque = power / (2.0 * std::f64::consts::PI * cadence_hz);

    // Calculate force on the pedal
    let pedal_force = torque / crank_arm_length;

    // Output results
    println!("Velocity: {:.2} m/s", velocity_ms);
    println!("Drag Force: {:.2} N", drag_force);
    println!("Power Required: {:.2} W", power);
    println!("Torque Generated: {:.2} Nm", torque);
    println!("Force on Pedal: {:.2} N", pedal_force);
}
```

### **5. Explanation of the Code**
1. **Input Parameters**:
   - Rider mass, velocity, air density, drag coefficient, frontal area, and crank arm length are defined as constants.
2. **Drag Force**:
   - Calculated using the drag equation.
3. **Power**:
   - Derived from the drag force and velocity.
4. **Torque**:
   - Estimated based on power and cadence (assumed to be 90 RPM).
5. **Pedal Force**:
   - Computed from torque and crank arm length.

### **6. Example Output**
When you run the program, you might see something like this:
```
Velocity: 11.11 m/s
Drag Force: 74.83 N
Power Required: 832.04 W
Torque Generated: 88.47 Nm
Force on Pedal: 520.41 N
```

This means that to maintain a speed of 40 km/h, you need to apply approximately **520 N** of force to the pedal.

### **7. Notes**
- The actual force will vary depending on factors like your riding position, bike efficiency, and wind conditions.
- If you want to include rolling resistance or inclines, you’ll need to modify the calculations accordingly.
