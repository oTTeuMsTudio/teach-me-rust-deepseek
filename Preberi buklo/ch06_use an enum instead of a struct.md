# What is an `enum`?
An `enum` (short for "enumeration") is a way to define a type that can have a fixed set of values, called **variants**. Each variant can optionally hold additional data.

In this case, the `IpAddr` enum represents two types of IP addresses:
1. **V4**: IPv4 addresses (like `127.0.0.1`)
2. **V6**: IPv6 addresses (like `::1`)

### Why use an `enum` instead of a struct?
Instead of creating a struct with separate fields for the address type and its value, we can directly associate data (like the IP address string) with each variant of the `enum`. This makes the code shorter and easier to understand.

---

### How does it work here?

Here’s the definition of the `IpAddr` enum:

```rust
enum IpAddr {
    V4(String),
    V6(String),
}
```

- The `V4` variant holds a `String` representing an IPv4 address.
- The `V6` variant holds a `String` representing an IPv6 address.

This means:
- When you create a value of type `IpAddr`, you choose either `V4` or `V6` and provide the associated `String` value.

---

### Example Code Explanation

```rust
let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));
```

- Here, we create a value `home` of type `IpAddr`.
- We use the `V4` variant to represent an IPv4 address.
- The `String::from("127.0.0.1")` creates a `String` containing the IP address `"127.0.0.1"`, which is associated with the `V4` variant.

```rust
let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

- Similarly, we create another value `loopback` of type `IpAddr`.
- This time, we use the `V6` variant to represent an IPv6 address.
- The `String::from("::1")` creates a `String` containing the IP address `"::1"`, which is associated with the `V6` variant.

---

### Why is this concise and useful?

1. **No need for extra structs**: Instead of having a separate struct to hold the IP address type and its value, the `enum` combines everything into one neat package.
2. **Clear and readable**: It’s immediately clear that `V4` and `V6` are the only possible types of IP addresses, and each has its own associated data.
3. **Type safety**: Rust ensures that you can’t accidentally mix up `V4` and `V6` addresses because they’re different variants of the same `enum`.

---

### Summary

The `IpAddr` enum is a clean and concise way to represent IP addresses. It uses two variants:
- `V4(String)` for IPv4 addresses.
- `V6(String)` for IPv6 addresses.

Each variant stores the corresponding IP address as a `String`. In the example:
- `home` is an IPv4 address (`127.0.0.1`).
- `loopback` is an IPv6 address (`::1`).

This approach avoids unnecessary complexity while keeping the code easy to read and maintain.

**Final Answer:**
The `IpAddr` enum allows us to represent both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses concisely by associating a `String` value with each variant (`V4` and `V6`).
