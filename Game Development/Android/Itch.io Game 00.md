Let's walk through how to create and sell a game using **Easel** (a platform for making multiplayer games) and distribute it on platforms like **itch.io**.

### 🌟 Step 1: Learn the Basics of Easel
You're already off to a great start by exploring the official Easel tutorials:
- [Quickstart Guide](https://easel.games/docs/learn/quickstart/) – This teaches you how to build a single-player game called *Astroblast* and turn it into a multiplayer game.
- [Tutorial: Techniques](https://easel.games/docs/learn/tutorial-techniques/) – This dives deeper into advanced features like powerups, dynamic enemies, and visual effects.

These guides will help you understand:
- How to create interactive characters and environments.
- How to add simple multiplayer functionality with minimal effort.
- How to use the built-in editor and scripting tools.

✅ **Action:** Complete both tutorials. Try building your own version of Astroblast or experiment with new ideas.

### 🎮 Step 2: Build Your Game
Once you’re comfortable with the basics, start working on your original game idea. Here’s a checklist:

#### ✅ 1. Pick a Simple Idea
Choose a genre like:
- Platformer
- Puzzle game
- Top-down shooter
- Endless runner

#### ✅ 2. Plan the Core Mechanics
Decide what makes your game fun:
- Movement & controls
- Enemies or obstacles
- Powerups or upgrades
- Scoring system

#### ✅ 3. Use Easel Tools
- Use the **visual editor** to design levels.
- Use **JavaScript** to code behaviors.
- Add **multiplayer** support later if desired.

#### ✅ 4. Test Often
Test every feature as you go. Fix bugs early.

### 💾 Step 3: Export and Prepare for Distribution
Easel allows you to export your game as a **web-ready HTML5 file**, which is perfect for platforms like itch.io.

#### To Export from Easel:
1. Go to the **Game Settings** in the Easel editor.
2. Click “Export” or “Build” (exact steps may vary).
3. Download the ZIP file containing your game files (HTML, JS, assets).

#### Optional: Customize Your Exported Files
You can open the exported folder and:
- Add a custom `index.html` splash screen.
- Include credits, instructions, or social links.
- Optimize images or sounds for performance.
