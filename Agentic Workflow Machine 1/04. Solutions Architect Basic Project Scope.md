Certainly! Below is a structured explanation of how you can approach creating a basic project scope for a Solutions Architect in Rust, including determining if CRUD operations are required, if user login is required, if external rules (APIs or integrations) are needed, and printing site URLs.

---

### **Step 1: Define the Project Scope**
Before writing any code, it's essential to define the scope of the project. Here's a checklist:
1. **CRUD Operations**: Determine if the application requires Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities.
2. **User Login**: Decide if user authentication (login/signup) is necessary.
3. **External Rules/Integrations**: Identify if the application needs to interact with external APIs or services.
4. **Site URLs**: List the URLs that the application will expose or use.

---

### **Step 2: Implement the Logic in Rust**
Below is a Rust program that captures this logic and prints the results:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Welcome to the Project Scope Assistant!");

    // Step 1: Determine if CRUD operations are required
    let crud_required = ask_yes_no("Are CRUD operations required?");

    // Step 2: Determine if user login is required
    let user_login_required = ask_yes_no("Is user login required?");

    // Step 3: Determine if external rules/integrations are required
    let external_rules_required = ask_yes_no("Are external rules or integrations required?");

    // Step 4: Collect site URLs
    let site_urls = collect_site_urls();

    // Print the results
    println!("\n--- Project Scope Summary ---");
    println!("CRUD Operations Required: {}", if crud_required { "Yes" } else { "No" });
    println!("User Login Required: {}", if user_login_required { "Yes" } else { "No" });
    println!(
        "External Rules/Integrations Required: {}",
        if external_rules_required { "Yes" } else { "No" }
    );
    println!("Site URLs:");
    for url in &site_urls {
        println!("- {}", url);
    }
}

// Function to ask yes/no questions
fn ask_yes_no(question: &str) -> bool {
    loop {
        println!("{}", question);
        println!("Please enter 'yes' or 'no':");

        let mut input = String::new();
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut input)
            .expect("Failed to read input");

        let response = input.trim().to_lowercase();
        if response == "yes" {
            return true;
        } else if response == "no" {
            return false;
        } else {
            println!("Invalid input. Please enter 'yes' or 'no'.");
        }
    }
}

// Function to collect site URLs
fn collect_site_urls() -> Vec<String> {
    let mut urls = Vec::new();
    loop {
        println!("Enter a site URL (or type 'done' to finish):");

        let mut input = String::new();
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut input)
            .expect("Failed to read input");

        let url = input.trim().to_string();
        if url.to_lowercase() == "done" {
            break;
        } else if !url.is_empty() {
            urls.push(url);
        }
    }

    urls
}
```

### **Explanation of the Code**
1. **`ask_yes_no` Function**:
   - This function prompts the user with a yes/no question and validates the input.
   - It ensures that only "yes" or "no" responses are accepted.

2. **`collect_site_urls` Function**:
   - This function allows the user to input multiple site URLs.
   - The loop continues until the user types "done".

3. **Main Function**:
   - The main function orchestrates the entire process:
     - Asks whether CRUD operations, user login, and external rules are required.
     - Collects site URLs.
     - Prints the summary of the project scope.

### **Sample Output**
Hereâ€™s an example of how the program might run:

```
Welcome to the Project Scope Assistant!
Are CRUD operations required?
Please enter 'yes' or 'no':
yes
Is user login required?
Please enter 'yes' or 'no':
yes
Are external rules or integrations required?
Please enter 'yes' or 'no':
no
Enter a site URL (or type 'done' to finish):
https://example.com
Enter a site URL (or type 'done' to finish):
https://api.example.com
Enter a site URL (or type 'done' to finish):
done

--- Project Scope Summary ---
CRUD Operations Required: Yes
User Login Required: Yes
External Rules/Integrations Required: No
Site URLs:
- https://example.com
- https://api.example.com
```

---

### **Key Notes**
1. **Extensibility**:
   - You can extend this program to include more features, such as database selection, technology stack preferences, or deployment environments.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - The program includes basic error handling for invalid inputs.

3. **Practical Use**:
   - This tool can help Solutions Architects quickly gather requirements and generate a project scope document.
