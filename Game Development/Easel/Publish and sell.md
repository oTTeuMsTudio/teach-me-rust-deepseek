Based on the information available from [Easel.games](https://easel.games/), here's how you can publish and potentially sell games using their platform:

### **How to Publish Games with Easel**
1. **Create Your Game Online**:
   - Easel provides an **online game editor**, which means you can create and edit your game directly in a web browser.
   - No setup is required — simply open the editor and start building.

2. **Test Your Game Instantly**:
   - You can test your game as you build it, thanks to Easel’s built-in tools and live updates.
   - Multiplayer functionality works seamlessly without needing to handle networking manually.

3. **Publish Your Game**:
   - Once your game is ready, Easel allows you to **publish it instantly**.
   - Easel hosts your game on its servers, making it accessible to anyone with a web browser.
   - Players don’t need to download anything — they can just play your game online.

4. **Share Your Game**:
   - After publishing, Easel gives you a link or embed code so you can share your game on social media, websites, or game portals.

### **Can You Sell Games Made with Easel?**
The official Easel website does **not explicitly mention** selling games directly through the platform. However, here are some potential ways to monetize or distribute your game:

#### 1. **Offer Your Game for Free (with Attribution)**
   - Since Easel hosts your game, you can offer it for free and promote it via social media, itch.io, or other platforms.
   - You may be able to request donations or support through external services like Patreon or Buy Me a Coffee.

#### 2. **Export and Sell Elsewhere (Unclear)**  
   - The site doesn't specify whether Easel supports exporting your game to standalone files (like .exe or mobile APKs).
   - If this feature exists (or becomes available), you could export your game and sell it on platforms like:
     - **itch.io**
     - **Steam** (for desktop games)
     - **Google Play / App Store** (for mobile games)

> 🛑 **Note**: At the time of writing, it seems Easel is designed primarily for hosting browser-based multiplayer games directly on its platform. Exporting or selling your game as a standalone product may not be supported yet.

#### 3. **Use External Monetization Methods**
   - If your game is hosted by Easel but publicly accessible, you might integrate third-party ads (like Google AdSense) if you host the game on your own website.
   - Alternatively, you could use crowdfunding or sponsorship models while directing players to your Easel-hosted game.

### **Best Practices for Selling or Sharing Games**
- **Build a Portfolio Website**: Showcase all your Easel games and include links or embedded versions of them.
- **Promote on Social Media & Communities**: Use Twitter/X, Reddit, Discord, and game dev forums to share your work.
- **Submit to Game Jams**: Try submitting your Easel game to game jams or competitions for visibility and possible prizes.
- **Collaborate with Others**: Easel makes multiplayer easy — consider working with artists or designers to make polished games that attract more players.
