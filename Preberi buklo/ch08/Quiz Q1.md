The provided Rust function aims to remove zeros from a mutable vector in-place. However, the implementation leads to a **compiler error** due to conflicting borrow requirements.

---

### Key Concepts Involved:

- **Borrowing Rules in Rust**: Rust enforces strict borrowing rules to ensure memory safety. At any given time, you can have either:
  - One or more **immutable borrows**, or
  - Exactly **one mutable borrow**, but not both.

- **Iterator and Borrowing**: The line `v.iter()` creates an **immutable borrow** of the vector `v`, which is held for the duration of the loop.

- **Mutable Method Call**: The `v.remove(i)` method requires a **mutable borrow** of the vector to modify its contents.

---

### Why the Error Occurs:

In the loop:

```rust
for (i, t) in v.iter().enumerate().rev() {
    if *t == 0 {
        v.remove(i);
        v.shrink_to_fit();
    }
}
```

- `v.iter()` creates an **immutable borrow** of the vector `v`.
- Inside the loop, `v.remove(i)` attempts to **mutably borrow** the same vector.
- Since both borrows (immutable and mutable) are active at the same time, this **violates Rust's borrowing rules**.

This results in a **compile-time error** indicating that `v` cannot be borrowed as mutable while it is already borrowed as immutable.

---

### Correct Interpretation of the Compiler Error:

Among the given choices:

- **"v does not live long enough to call v.remove(i)"** — Incorrect. The vector lives as long as the function.
- **"v.remove(i) cannot borrow v as mutable"** — ✅ **Correct.** This is the core issue: the immutable borrow from the iterator prevents a mutable borrow for `remove`.
- **"v.iter() cannot be called on a mutable reference"** — Incorrect. You **can** call `.iter()` on a `&mut Vec`, as it only requires a shared reference.
- **"t cannot be dereferenced while i is live"** — Incorrect. There is no conflict between `t` and `i`.

---

### Conclusion:

The function fails to compile because **the iterator holds an immutable borrow of the vector, preventing the mutable borrow required by `v.remove(i)`**.

$$
\boxed{\text{v.remove(i) cannot borrow v as mutable}}
