# Calculate force exerted 
Let's break this problem into manageable steps and write a Rust program to calculate the force exerted on the bike pedal. Here's how we'll approach it:

---

### **Understanding the Problem**
1. **Inputs**:
   - Weight of the rider (in kilograms, e.g., 90 kg).
   - Driving speed (in meters per second or kilometers per hour, depending on the user input format).

2. **Outputs**:
   - The force exerted on the bike pedal.

3. **Assumptions**:
   - We assume that the force is related to the rider's weight and their driving speed.
   - For simplicity, let's use a basic formula:  
     $ \text{Force} = \text{Weight} \times \text{Speed Factor} $  
     where the "Speed Factor" is a multiplier derived from the driving speed.

4. **Steps**:
   - Prompt the user for their weight and driving speed.
   - Convert the inputs into appropriate units (if necessary).
   - Calculate the force using the formula.
   - Display the result.

### **Rust Program**

Hereâ€™s the complete Rust program:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    // Prompt the user for their weight
    println!("Enter your weight (in kilograms):");
    let weight = read_user_input();

    // Prompt the user for their driving speed
    println!("Enter your driving speed (in km/h):");
    let speed_kmh = read_user_input();

    // Convert speed from km/h to m/s
    let speed_ms = speed_kmh / 3.6;

    // Define a simple speed factor (arbitrary constant for demonstration)
    let speed_factor = speed_ms * 0.1; // Adjust this as needed

    // Calculate the force
    let force = weight * speed_factor;

    // Display the result
    println!(
        "The force exerted on the bike pedal is approximately {:.2} N",
        force
    );
}

// Helper function to read user input as a floating-point number
fn read_user_input() -> f64 {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut input)
        .expect("Failed to read input");

    input.trim().parse::<f64>().expect("Please enter a valid number")
}
```

---

### **Explanation of the Code**

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The `read_user_input` function reads a line of input from the user and converts it into a `f64` (floating-point number). It uses `trim()` to remove any leading/trailing whitespace and `parse::<f64>()` to convert the string into a number.

2. **Unit Conversion**:
   - Since driving speed is entered in kilometers per hour (km/h), we convert it to meters per second (m/s) using the formula:  
     $$
     \text{Speed in m/s} = \frac{\text{Speed in km/h}}{3.6}
     $$

3. **Force Calculation**:
   - We define a simple "speed factor" as $ \text{Speed in m/s} \times 0.1 $. This is an arbitrary multiplier for demonstration purposes. You can adjust this based on more complex physics or real-world data.
   - The force is then calculated as:  
     $$
     \text{Force} = \text{Weight} \times \text{Speed Factor}
     $$

4. **Output**:
   - The result is displayed with two decimal places using Rust's formatting syntax `{:.2}`.

### **Example Run**

#### Input:
```
Enter your weight (in kilograms):
90
Enter your driving speed (in km/h):
36
```

#### Output:
```
The force exerted on the bike pedal is approximately 90.00 N
```

### **How to Run the Program**

1. Install Rust if you haven't already:
   ```
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. Save the code in a file, e.g., `bike_force.rs`.

3. Compile and run the program:
   ```
   rustc bike_force.rs
   ./bike_force
   ```

### **Final Notes**

- The formula used here is a simplified approximation. If you have a more accurate formula for calculating the force on a bike pedal, you can replace the calculation logic.
- Ensure the user enters valid numbers. The program will panic if invalid input is provided (e.g., text instead of numbers). You can enhance error handling if needed.
