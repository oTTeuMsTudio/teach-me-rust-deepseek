# Assigning roles to managing agent, solutions architect and backend developer

Creating a sea ship construction game in Rust involves integrating concepts from multiple domains: game design, software architecture, and backend development. Lets go through the process by breaking it into manageable steps, assigning roles to the managing agent, solutions architect, and backend developer, and providing code snippets where appropriate.

---

### **1. Define the Problem and Requirements**
The managing agent is responsible for defining the scope of the project. Let's assume the following requirements:

- Players can construct ships by selecting components (e.g., hull, engine, weapons).
- Ships have attributes like speed, durability, and firepower.
- A backend system stores player progress and ship designs.
- The game should be extensible for future features (e.g., multiplayer, combat mechanics).

---

### **2. Design the Architecture**
The solutions architect designs the high-level structure of the application. Here's a proposed architecture:

#### **Components**
1. **Core Game Logic**: Handles ship construction and attribute calculations.
2. **Backend Service**: Stores player data and ship designs in a database.
3. **API Layer**: Facilitates communication between the game and the backend.
4. **Frontend Interface**: Provides a user-friendly way to interact with the game (not covered here, but could be implemented later).

#### **Technology Stack**
- **Rust**: For core game logic and backend service.
- **SQL Database**: For storing player data and ship designs.
- **HTTP API**: For communication between the game and backend.

---

### **3. Implement Core Game Logic**
The backend developer writes the core game logic in Rust. Below is an example implementation:

#### **Define Ship Components**
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Hull {
    name: String,
    durability: u32,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Engine {
    name: String,
    speed: u32,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Weapon {
    name: String,
    firepower: u32,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Ship {
    hull: Hull,
    engine: Engine,
    weapon: Weapon,
}
```

#### **Calculate Ship Attributes**
```rust
impl Ship {
    fn new(hull: Hull, engine: Engine, weapon: Weapon) -> Self {
        Ship { hull, engine, weapon }
    }

    fn calculate_speed(&self) -> u32 {
        self.engine.speed - (self.hull.durability / 10)
    }

    fn calculate_firepower(&self) -> u32 {
        self.weapon.firepower + (self.engine.speed / 5)
    }

    fn calculate_durability(&self) -> u32 {
        self.hull.durability + (self.weapon.firepower / 10)
    }
}
```

#### **Example Usage**
```rust
fn main() {
    let hull = Hull {
        name: String::from("Titanium Hull"),
        durability: 100,
    };

    let engine = Engine {
        name: String::from("Nuclear Engine"),
        speed: 80,
    };

    let weapon = Weapon {
        name: String::from("Plasma Cannon"),
        firepower: 60,
    };

    let ship = Ship::new(hull, engine, weapon);

    println!("Ship Speed: {}", ship.calculate_speed());
    println!("Ship Firepower: {}", ship.calculate_firepower());
    println!("Ship Durability: {}", ship.calculate_durability());
}
```

---

### **4. Develop the Backend Service**
The backend developer creates a RESTful API using Actix Web or Rocket in Rust. Below is an example using Actix Web:

#### **Setup Dependencies**
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
actix-web = "4"
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
sqlx = { version = "0.6", features = ["runtime-tokio-native-tls", "postgres"] }
```

#### **Define Database Schema**
Create a PostgreSQL table for storing ship designs:
```sql
CREATE TABLE ship_designs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    hull TEXT NOT NULL,
    engine TEXT NOT NULL,
    weapon TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

#### **Implement Backend Logic**
```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use sqlx::PgPool;

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct ShipDesign {
    hull: String,
    engine: String,
    weapon: String,
}

async fn create_ship_design(
    pool: web::Data<PgPool>,
    design: web::Json<ShipDesign>,
) -> HttpResponse {
    sqlx::query!(
        "INSERT INTO ship_designs (hull, engine, weapon) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)",
        design.hull,
        design.engine,
        design.weapon
    )
    .execute(pool.get_ref())
    .await
    .unwrap();

    HttpResponse::Created().json(design.into_inner())
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let database_url = "postgres://username:password@localhost/mydb";
    let pool = PgPool::connect(database_url).await.unwrap();

    HttpServer::new(move || {
        App::new()
            .app_data(web::Data::new(pool.clone()))
            .route("/ships", web::post().to(create_ship_design))
    })
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
    .run()
    .await
}
```

---

### **5. Integrate Frontend and Backend**
The managing agent ensures that the frontend communicates with the backend via HTTP requests. For simplicity, you can use tools like `curl` or Postman to test the API endpoints.

Example `curl` command to create a ship design:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/ships \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"hull": "Titanium Hull", "engine": "Nuclear Engine", "weapon": "Plasma Cannon"}'
```

---

### **6. Extend and Optimize**
The solutions architect plans for future extensions:
- Add authentication for player accounts.
- Implement multiplayer functionality using WebSockets.
- Optimize database queries for performance.

---

### **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how to build a sea ship construction game in Rust by dividing responsibilities among a managing agent, solutions architect, and backend developer. The core game logic is implemented in Rust, while the backend provides persistent storage and API endpoints. You can further enhance the game by adding more features and refining the architecture.
